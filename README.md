Hi, I’m @HonkAmGoose.
I’m interested in programming and ethical hacking.
I started learning programming with python and am most confident with it but I know quite a bit of java and a tiny bit of webdev.
I am looking to learn C, its derivatives and golang as well as increasing my knowledge of web development.
For ethical hacking, I use youtube as well as overthewire and tryhackme.
